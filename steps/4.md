## Step 4: Adding some proper content

We've had a bit of a play with HTML now, so now let's get down to building our website.  Replace the contents of the `<body>` element as follows:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>Motivational posters</h1>
  </header>
</body>
```

Next, we'll add a section, step by step, for searching for images on Google.

Right now, your website should look something like this:

![screenshot](/images/step_4/motivational_header.png)

> Note: most of the screenshots that follow were taken from a version of this project that was not hosted on Cloud9, which is why the URL is different.

Next add a `<section>` tag directly after the closing `</header>` tag:

```html
<header>
  <h1>Motivational posters</h1>
</header>
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
</section>
```

It's very similar to the `<header>` element above it, but has two differences. First, we're using the `<h2>` tag for the heading, instead of `<h1>`. This indicates a second-level heading.  Secondly, we are giving this section an **id** of `select-image`. We will have lots of `<section>` elements in our final HTML and it will be useful to be able to refer to them individually.

Let's add add a paragraph of text:

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
</section>
```

Now your page should look like this:

![screenshot](/images/step_4/select_image.png)

Next, we'll add a **form** with an **input field** to allow our user to enter a keyword:

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <form id="search-form">
    <input id="search-term" type="text">
  </form>
</section>
```

There are a number of types of input field that a browser can provide.  In this case, we want a text box, which we specify to the browser using the attribute `type="text"`.  Another type of input field is a 'submit' button, which we will add next:

> You may know that there is a `<button>` tag in HTML.  However, we don't use it here because we actually want something more specific.

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <form id="search-form">
    <input id="search-term" type="text">
    <input id="submit-search" type="submit" value="Go!">
  </form>
</section>
```

Lastly, we'll need somewhere on the page for the search results to go.  Normally, we'd cross that bridge when we come to it, but while we're here let's cheat a bit and add it now:

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <form id="search-form">
    <input id="search-term" type="text">
    <input id="submit-search" type="submit" value="Go!">
  </form>
  <div id="search-results"></div>
</section>
```

`<div>` is a generic tag frequently used to create container elements and elements we'll later interact with using JavaScript.  As it's currently empty, it won't be visible on the page.

Oh, and post-lastly(!), it is a requirement of the Google Image Search API, which we will be using next, to include a 'powered by Google' image on the page.  We'll quickly add a placeholder for that too:

```html
<section id="select-image">
  <h2>Step 1. Select an image</h2>
  <p>Enter the keyword to search for images</p>
  <form id="search-form">
    <input id="search-term" type="text">
    <input type="submit" value="Go!">
  </form>
  <div id="search-results"></div>
  <div id="google-branding"></div>
</section>
```

So, this is what our application looks like now.
